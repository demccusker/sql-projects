# sql-projects
A place to put SQL projects


The current only project was finished before I learned github, so it only includes the final version, not any of its history. This project satisfied all the requirements to complete the SQL module of Udacity's nanodegree in Python for Data Science. The database used for this project is available here: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/
